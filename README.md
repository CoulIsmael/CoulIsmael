This GitHub repository serves as a personal tracker for my projects and progress as I learn object-oriented programming and machine learning fundamentals. It will document my journey through coding exercises, hands-on implementations, and conceptual explorations, showcasing my growth in these domains. By maintaining this repository, I aim to improve my understanding, track my learning milestones, and share my work with others who might find it helpful.
